**Clinical Impression:**

The patient presents with symptoms of slurred speech and left-sided weakness, which have worsened over time. The radiology findings suggest a small clot in the proximal sylvian fissure segment of the right middle cerebral artery branch, which is approximately 7 mm in size. This clot is associated with perfusion abnormalities on cerebral blood flow, time to drain, and mean transit time maps, indicating tissue at risk. The cerebral blood volume maps do not show a deficit, suggesting that the clot is not causing significant ischemic damage to the surrounding brain tissue.

**Key Findings:**

* Small clot in the proximal sylvian fissure segment of the right middle cerebral artery branch
* Perfusion abnormalities on cerebral blood flow, time to drain, and mean transit time maps
* Tissue at risk due to the clot
* Mild atherosclerotic change in the carotid bifurcations without significant stenoses

**Implications for Patient Care:**

The presence of a small clot in the proximal sylvian fissure segment of the right middle cerebral artery branch, combined with perfusion abnormalities, suggests that the patient is at risk for ischemic stroke. The mild atherosclerotic change in the carotid bifurcations may also contribute to the development of atherosclerotic disease, which could increase the risk of stroke. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the best course of action for the patient.

**Recommendations:**

* Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and neurological status
* Further imaging studies, such as MRI or MRA, to confirm the presence and location of the clot
* Evaluation of the patient's carotid arteries for significant stenosis or other vascular abnormalities
* Consideration of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of further clot formation or stroke

**Critical Findings:**

The report contains critical findings that may be critical to patient care, including the presence of a small clot in the proximal sylvian fissure segment of the right middle cerebral artery branch and perfusion abnormalities. These findings should be discussed with the patient and their healthcare team to determine the best course of action.<|eot_id|>",0.6666666666666667,,llama_base,"Noncontrast CT:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient, a 44-year-old male, presents with a history of assault. The CT scans reveal a complex pattern of injuries, primarily affecting the facial bones and orbits. The most significant finding is the acute rupture of the left globe, with extensive surrounding swelling, fluid, edema, and a few foci of air. This suggests a severe traumatic injury to the left eye, which may require urgent attention.

The CT scans also show scattered mildly prominent bilateral cervical lymph nodes, which are likely reactive in etiology. However, there is no evidence of fracture or traumatic subluxation within the cervical spine.

The findings in the head and brain CT scans are notable for the parallel configuration of the lateral ventricles, suggesting agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, there is no mass effect or midline shift, and no acute intracranial hemorrhage or loss of gray-white differentiation to suggest acute territorial infarction.

The maxillofacial CT scans reveal acute, mildly displaced bilateral nasal bone fractures with associated paranasal soft tissue swelling. There is also infiltration of the retrobulbar fat and stranding about the left optic nerve sheath complex, suggesting hemorrhage without organized hematoma.

Overall, the patient's injuries appear to be primarily traumatic in nature, with significant facial and orbital trauma.

The patient, a 42-year-old female, presented with shortness of breath and chest pain, and a CT chest with intravenous contrast was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism. The findings suggest that the patient does not have an acute pulmonary embolism, as there is no evidence of focal filling defects in the pulmonary artery branches.

However, the patient does have some concerning findings that may be related to her underlying medical history and current symptoms. The mildly dilated appearance of the pulmonary artery at its main trunk (32 mm) could be related to pulmonary hypertension, which is a potential complication of her history of sleeve gastrectomy. The presence of mildly dilated pulmonary arteries and minimal diffuse bronchial wall thickening, particularly in the lower lobes, may indicate chronic pulmonary hypertension.

The patient also has bilateral atelectatic and ventilatory changes of the lung parenchyma, which could be related to her symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. The mosaic attenuation of the lung parenchyma, which may be related to air trapping, and the few subpleural groundglass densities in the right lower lobe, may indicate hypoventilatory changes.

The patient's liver attenuation is decreased, consistent with fatty liver, and there are partially visualized postsurgical changes of prior sleeve gastrectomy. The absence of pleural effusions, enlarged mediastinal, bilateral hilar, or axillary lymph nodes, and worrisome bone lesions suggests that the patient does not have an acute infectious or inflammatory process.

The patient presents with pleurisy, right-sided chest pain, and right upper quadrant pain, and the radiologist suspects pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or empyema. The CT chest and abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast images reveal several findings that support these suspicions.

The right interlobar artery pulmonary embolism with extension into right lower lobe subsegmental branches is a significant finding, indicating a possible pulmonary embolism. The non-enhancing dependent lung tissue, likely representing lung infarct, further supports this diagnosis. The small right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis and the trace left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis may be related to the pulmonary embolism.

The numerous centrilobular nodularity in bilateral lower lobes and right middle lobe, new compared to prior study, may represent aspiration or an inflammatory/infectious process. However, the presence of a small right middle lobe nodule measuring 0.5 cm and the unchanged right middle lobe nodule measuring 0.5 cm (5-396) may also be related to the pulmonary embolism.

The findings in the abdomen and pelvis are largely unremarkable, with no evidence of intra-abdominal free air, bowel dilation, or wall thickening. The small ascites and small fat-containing umbilical hernia are noted, but these are not directly related to the suspected pulmonary embolism.

Overall, the radiologist's findings suggest a pulmonary embolism, possibly with associated pleural effusions and lung infarct. Further evaluation and management should be considered to address these findings.

Recommendations:

* Further evaluation for pulmonary embolism, including D-dimer and/or CT pulmonary angiography
* Consideration of anticoagulation therapy
* Monitoring for signs of pleural effusion and lung infarct
* Further evaluation for the new centrilobular nodularity in bilateral lower lobes and right middle lobe

The patient, a 6/25 visit to the Chestertown ED, presented with right chest pain and was evaluated for a triple rule out, including pulmonary embolism, heart attack, and esophageal rupture. The Wells score of 3 suggests a moderate pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism.

The CT chest study with intravenous contrast revealed mild cardiomegaly, mild coronary artery calcification, and a slightly prominent main pulmonary artery. However, the evaluation for pulmonary embolism is limited due to some segmental and subsegmental branches, and there is no central pulmonary embolism.

The most concerning finding is the bilateral diffuse scattered areas of central groundglass opacities with a mosaic pattern of attenuation, associated with mild interstitial thickening. This pattern is suggestive of pulmonary embolism, particularly in the context of the patient's symptoms and the limited evaluation for pulmonary embolism. The right small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis further supports this finding.

The presence of bilateral diffuse scattered areas of groundglass opacities is concerning for pulmonary embolism, and the radiologist's notation of ""evaluation for pulmonary embolism is limited"" suggests that the study may not have captured the full extent of the disease. I would recommend further evaluation, such as a ventilation-perfusion scan or a CT pulmonary angiogram, to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's Wells score of 3 and the presence of right chest pain, along with the radiological findings, suggest that the patient may have a significant pulmonary embolism.

Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: Parvinder Sujlana, MD  Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: Gary X. Gong, MD","Based on the provided radiology report narrative, here's my impression:

The patient underwent a CT angiography (CTA) of the head with contrast to investigate concerns for vasospasm. The findings indicate mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the cavernous and clinoid internal carotid arteries, which are bilaterally present. This calcification results in mild narrowing of the lumen, but the caliber is restored distally. The anterior cerebral arteries appear normal, and there are no notable abnormalities in the cerebral arteries bilaterally.

However, the right vertebral artery is hypoplastic, and there is compensatory enlargement of the left vertebral artery. This suggests a possible vascular anomaly or congenital condition affecting the right vertebral artery. The basilar artery is unremarkable, and the posterior cerebral arteries are patent.

Given the patient's concern for vasospasm, it's essential to consider the potential implications of this vascular anomaly. The hypoplastic right vertebral artery may be a contributing factor to the patient's symptoms. Further evaluation and management may be necessary to address this finding and alleviate any potential symptoms.

As a medical assistant, I would recommend that the radiologist and the patient's primary care physician discuss the findings and consider the following:

1. Further evaluation: Consider additional imaging studies, such as a 4D CT angiography or a digital subtraction angiography (DSA), to better visualize the right vertebral artery and assess its impact on cerebral blood flow.
2. Management: Develop a plan to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This may include medication, lifestyle modifications, or other interventions to manage vasospasm.
3. Follow-up: Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

"IMPRESSION:  1.  No pulmonary embolism to subsegmental level. 2.  Extensive apical and paraseptal predominant emphysema. 3.  Bronchial wall thickening and scattered mucus plugging of the right greater than left lower lobe distal airways, likely secondary to bronchitis.  Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: David Gullotti, MD  Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: Homeira Zahiri","Based on the radiology report, here's my impression:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath and chest pain, which led to a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) of the chest with intravenous contrast. The findings suggest that the patient has a significant respiratory issue.

The key findings include:

* Extensive apical and paraseptal predominant emphysema, which is a type of chronic lung disease characterized by the destruction of lung tissue.
* Dependent bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis, which is a condition where a portion of the lung is not expanding properly.
* Bronchial wall thickening with scattered mucous plugging of the right greater than left lower lobe distal airways, which may indicate chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Mild coronary calcifications, which may indicate atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease.

There is no evidence of acute pathology, such as a pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinum, thyroid, and lymph nodes appear normal.

Given the patient's symptoms and the radiology findings, I would suspect that the patient has a chronic respiratory condition, such as COPD or chronic bronchitis, which is causing her shortness of breath and chest pain. The presence of emphysema and bronchial wall thickening supports this diagnosis. Further evaluation, such as a pulmonary function test or a chest X-ray, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.

I would also like to note that the patient's coronary calcifications may be a concern for cardiovascular disease, and further evaluation, such as an echocardiogram or a cardiac MRI, may be necessary to assess the patient's cardiac function and risk for cardiovascular disease.<|eot_id|>",0.5194805194805195,,llama_base,"CHEST: Lung/Airways:  Minimal adherent mucus to the right sidewall of the right mainstem bronchus.

The patient is an unknown age female who was found down with a reported fall from an unknown height, possibly a fall prior to the day of the examination. The CT head and maxillofacial regions were examined without intravenous contrast, and the cervical spine was examined without contrast as well.

The findings on the CT head reveal a trace subdural hemorrhage in the right parafalcine region, measuring up to 2 mm in thickness, with additional foci of hemorrhage along the right frontal convexity measuring up to 3 mm. There is also a 2 mm focus of hyperattenuation within the right frontal lobe, which may represent a small parenchymal hemorrhage or subarachnoid blood deep within a sulcus. Additionally, there are trace foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage noted within the right frontal sulci.

The CT maxillofacial examination shows no evidence of acute displaced maxillofacial or orbital fracture, and the orbits appear symmetric without retrobulbar pathology. There is also no significant facial soft tissue swelling or joint dislocation.

The CT cervical spine examination reveals no evidence of acute displaced cervical spine fracture or traumatic malalignment. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable, and there is minimal anterior hypertrophic spurring at C5-C6 with mild disc height loss.

Overall, the findings suggest a possible traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a subdural hemorrhage, possibly resulting from the reported fall.

The patient, a 74-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with weakness and difficulty speaking, which is a concerning symptom that warrants further investigation. The CT head examination without contrast reveals a centrally hypodense lesion with hyperattenuating periphery in the right frontal lobe, which is adjacent to a previously expanded postoperative cavity from a previous craniotomy and resection of a mass.

The differential diagnosis includes recurrent tumor versus old postoperative blood products, which suggests that the lesion may be a new development rather than a recurrence of the original tumor. However, the presence of vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the superior right lateral ventricle raises concerns about potential tumor recurrence or progression.

The fact that gray-white matter differentiation is preserved and basal cisterns are patent suggests that there is no significant mass effect on the brain's critical structures. However, the absence of acute intracranial hemorrhage is not entirely reassuring, as it may indicate that the lesion is not causing significant bleeding at this time.

The absence of midline shift is also reassuring, but the presence of a centrally hypodense lesion with hyperattenuating periphery in a postoperative cavity raises concerns about the patient's neurological status. I would recommend further evaluation and imaging, such as MRI with contrast, to better characterize the lesion and assess the patient's neurological status.

Given the patient's symptoms and the radiology findings, I would consider the following differential diagnoses:

1. Recurrent tumor
2. Old postoperative blood products
3. Infection or abscess
4. Cyst or abscess formation

I would also consider the patient's medical history, including the previous craniotomy and resection of the mass, and the fact that the patient is 74 years old, which may increase the risk of certain conditions, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

1. **Sinusitis**: Moderate to severe mucosal thickening is present in the paranasal sinuses, indicating sinusitis. This may be related to the patient's recent trauma.
2. **Air-fluid levels**: Air-fluid levels are seen in the left maxillary sinus, which could be a sign of sinusitis or another process.
3. **Cervical spine**: The cervical spine examination shows mild reversal of the normal cervical lordosis, likely due to the use of a cervical collar. There are no acute fractures, listhesis, or suspicious osseous abnormalities.
4. **Lymphadenopathy**: Prominent bilateral cervical lymph nodes are present, which may be reactive in nature due to the trauma or another underlying process.

The patient is a 44-year-old male with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR). The MRI cardiac velocity flowmapping study reveals moderate tricuspid regurgitation and no significant mitral regurgitation. The left ventricle appears normal in size and function, while the right ventricle is mildly dilated.

The flow measurements indicate a relatively normal cardiac output, with a stroke volume of 76.8 ml/beat in the ascending aorta and 104.8 ml/beat in the main pulmonary artery. However, the regurgitant fraction in the main pulmonary artery is elevated at 6.0%, suggesting some degree of pulmonary regurgitation.

The functional measurements, including the QMASS (Quantitative Measurement of Left Ventricular Volume), indicate a normal left ventricular volume and stroke volume, but a slightly reduced ejection fraction of 60.86%. The right ventricular volume and stroke volume are elevated, with a reduced ejection fraction of 46.63%.

The presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions is noted, but it is unclear if this is related to the patient's underlying condition or a separate issue.

* The ascending aorta is dilated, measuring approximately 4.6 cm at the level of the right pulmonary artery, which may indicate atherosclerotic changes or possibly aortic dilation.
* Atherosclerotic changes are present in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta, which may contribute to the aortic dilation.
* Cardiomegaly is present, with mild coronary calcification, which may be related to the atherosclerotic changes.

The patient, a 34-year-old male, presented after a traumatic event with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and calvarial fracture. The current CT brain study without contrast shows multiple areas of hyperdense hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion in the right frontal and temporal lobes, which are more prominent on this study. This suggests ongoing bleeding or hematoma formation in these areas.

Additionally, there is a traumatic intrasulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage noted, which is consistent with the patient's history of trauma. The fracture of the left temporal bone with extension to the inferior left parietal bone is also evident, with moderate blood in the middle ear and left mastoid cells.

The ventricular system appears stable, with no hydrocephalus or midline shift. However, extensive soft tissue edema is present in the right temporal area, which may indicate ongoing inflammation or swelling.

The patient has a significant penetrating injury to the right eye, likely caused by a BB gun. The CT scan images reveal a 4 mm spherical metallic BB within the subcutaneous soft tissues of the right lateral scalp, which is associated with soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there is a 4 mm spherical metallic BB within the posterior superior orbit, causing contour irregularities, hemorrhage within the posterior chamber of the right globe, and globe rupture. The presence of a hematoma, small amount of free air, and soft tissue swelling of the orbit results in proptosis and posterior tenting of the globe, which may indicate optic nerve stretching. The shallow depth of the anterior chamber is also noted.

The patient's clinical history of prior nasal bone fractures and leftward deviation of the nasal septum may be relevant to the overall assessment of the patient's facial structure and potential complications. However, the primary concern is the severe eye injury, which may require urgent attention and further evaluation.

The findings do not indicate any acute intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial mass, or midline shift, which suggests that the injury is primarily limited to the eye and surrounding structures. However, the presence of a metallic BB within the orbit and globe rupture raises concerns about the potential for further complications, such as infection or vision loss.

Overall, the radiology report suggests a severe penetrating eye injury, which requires prompt attention and evaluation by an ophthalmologist or other specialist.

**Clinical Context:** The patient is a 75-year-old female who experienced a fall and was transported by ambulance (EMS) with a suspected anterior cervical spine (AC) injury. The radiology report was ordered to evaluate the head and cervical spine.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Intraventricular and Subdural Hemorrhage:** The CT head examination revealed focal hyperdensity in the fourth ventricle and greater-than-expected hyperdensity along the tentorial leaflets, which are suspicious for intraventricular and subdural hemorrhage, respectively.
2. **Supratentorial Ventriculomegaly:** There is mild to moderate supratentorial ventriculomegaly, which may reflect obstructive hydrocephalus.
3. **Subacute Blood Products:** Ill-defined hypodensity layering in the region of the left lateral ventricular occipital horn may represent subacute blood products.
4. **Cervical Spine Evaluation:** The CT cervical spine evaluation showed no acute fracture or facet malalignment, but there is multilevel degenerative disc disease with endplate spurring, facet and uncovertebral joint arthropathy, and varying degrees of mild to moderate foraminal narrowing.

**Impression:**

The patient has a significant head injury with evidence of intraventricular and subdural hemorrhage, which may be related to the fall. The supratentorial ventriculomegaly and subacute blood products suggest a possible obstructive hydrocephalus. The cervical spine evaluation is largely unremarkable, but the patient's age and history of fall increase the risk of cervical spine injury. The presence of multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy in the cervical spine may contribute to the patient's overall clinical presentation.

**Recommendations:**

1. **MRI of the Head:** The report suggests that MRI would be better for characterizing the findings, particularly the subacute blood products and obstructive hydrocephalus.
2. **Follow-up Imaging:** Consider follow-up imaging to assess the patient's neurological status and to monitor for any changes in the hemorrhage or ventriculomegaly.
3. **Cervical Spine Evaluation:** The patient's cervical spine evaluation is largely unremarkable, but it is essential to monitor the patient's neurological status and to consider further imaging if there are any concerns.

The patient, a 65-year-old male with a history of heart failure (HFrEF) and atrial fibrillation (AICD), presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The CT Angiography of the Chest reveals bilateral patchy ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, likely indicative of pulmonary edema. The patient's cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion are also consistent with heart failure.

The absence of pulmonary embolism is noted, which is reassuring. However, the presence of atherosclerotic calcifications, coronary artery calcifications, and the patient's history of AICD suggest a high burden of cardiovascular disease.

The small pericardial effusion and the presence of reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins are concerning for right heart dysfunction, which is consistent with the patient's history of heart failure. The marked cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion further support this finding.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and tachycardia are likely related to the patient's underlying heart failure and right heart dysfunction. The absence of pulmonary embolism and the presence of pulmonary edema suggest that the patient's symptoms are likely due to fluid overload and congestion in the lungs, rather than a pulmonary embolism.

The patient presents with sudden onset pleuritic right chest pain, which is a classic symptom of pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT angiography (CTA) scan confirms the presence of a pulmonary embolism originating from the distal right pulmonary artery and extending into multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. This is a significant finding, as it suggests a large and potentially life-threatening PE.

The presence of a 5 mm right upper lobe nodule (5, 212) is also notable, as it may be a separate entity from the pulmonary embolism. However, without further information, it's difficult to determine if this nodule is related to the PE or a separate pathology.

The bibasilar atelectatic changes and groundglass densities in the right middle lobe and lower lobes may indicate atelectasis or developing pulmonary infarct, which could be secondary to the PE. The absence of consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is reassuring, but the presence of bibasilar atelectasis and groundglass densities warrants further evaluation.

The normal heart size, absence of right heart strain, and normal caliber main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta suggest that the PE is not causing significant strain on the right heart. The LAD atherosclerotic calcifications are a separate finding that may be related to coronary artery disease.

The enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in the subcarinal region may be reactive, but their presence warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy or other pathology.

Overall, the patient's presentation and radiology findings suggest a significant pulmonary embolism, which requires prompt medical attention and treatment. Further evaluation, including further imaging and possibly intervention, may be necessary to manage the PE and its potential complications.<|eot_id|>",0.4827586206896552,,llama_base,"Sudden onset pleuritic right chest pain.

The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and has been experiencing symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) with hypoxia, tachycardia, and dyspnea. The radiologist has performed a pulmonary CT angiogram with IV contrast to evaluate the pulmonary arterial vasculature.

The findings suggest that the previously seen left lower lobe pulmonary embolus has resolved, and there is no new pulmonary embolism. The heart and pericardium appear normal, with no signs of right heart strain or cardiomegaly. However, there is moderate calcification of the coronary arteries.

The lungs and pleura show some changes, including:

* A large right lung base consolidative opacity, which is unchanged
* Diffuse bilateral bronchial wall thickening
* Innumerable bilateral tree-in-bud nodularity, which is unchanged
* Patchy groundglass opacity in the posterior right upper lobe, which is new
* Multiple upper lobe predominant patchy groundglass opacities, which are less conspicuous on the current exam
* Consolidative opacity in the right middle lobe with decreased lung volume, which is unchanged

The chest wall and axilla appear unremarkable, and there are multilevel degenerative changes of the included spine.

Given the patient's history of SCC and the current findings, it is possible that the patient has a new pulmonary complication, such as a pulmonary infection or a metastatic lesion. The presence of patchy groundglass opacity in the posterior right upper lobe and the consolidative opacity in the right middle lobe suggest a possible pulmonary infection or inflammation. The diffuse bilateral bronchial wall thickening and innumerable bilateral tree-in-bud nodularity may also be indicative of a pulmonary infection or inflammation.

However, without further information or additional imaging, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the pulmonary findings. Further evaluation and follow-up imaging may be necessary to determine the cause of the pulmonary changes and to monitor the patient's condition.

As a medical assistant, I would recommend that the radiologist review the patient's medical history and consider ordering additional imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray or a CT scan with contrast, to further evaluate the pulmonary findings.

The patient has a complex medical history with multiple chronic conditions affecting the chest and lungs. The current CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) study shows:

1. **Chronic right lower lobe consolidation and atelectasis**: Suggesting a long-standing inflammatory or infectious process.
2. **Unchanged left upper lobe groundglass opacities and tree-in-bud nodularity**: Indicating persistent lung injury or inflammation, possibly related to a previous pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. **Small right hydropneumothorax with basilar pigtail catheter in place**: A chronic pleural space complication, likely related to a previous thoracic surgery or procedure.
4. **Mild cardiomegaly**: Suggesting possible cardiac involvement or strain.
5. **Limited evaluation of the pulmonary arteries**: Due to motion artifact, which may impact the detection of acute PE.
6. **No definite acute pulmonary embolism**: However, the resolution of a previously seen right lower lobe pulmonary embolism in 11/2/2023 suggests that the patient may be at risk for future PE events.
7. **Gastrostomy tube in the stomach**: Suggesting a need for nutritional support and possibly a history of gastrointestinal issues.

Considering the patient's complex medical history and the findings on the CTPA study, I would recommend:

* Close monitoring for signs of acute PE or worsening lung disease.

"IMPRESSION:   1. No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality within the constraints of the exam.  2. Moderate generalized brain parenchymal volume loss and degree of supratentorial white matter changes reflective of chronic microvascular ischemia.  3. Right middle ear opacification with thickening of the bony EAC mucosa is suggestive of external and middle ear otitis. There are greater than right mastoid effusions. No discrete evidence of erosive changes involving the osseous structures of the  right middle ear cavity within the constraints of the examination. Normal opacification of the adjacent sigmoid sinuses and jugular veins.   Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: Matthew Kiczek, DO  Images and interpretation personally reviewed by: ROHINI NADGIR, MD","Based on the provided radiology report narrative, I would generate the following impression:

The patient presents with symptoms of hypotension and increased somnolence, which may be related to an infection. The CT head without contrast and with contrast images reveal moderate generalized brain parenchymal volume loss and ventriculomegaly, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. However, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift.

The maxillofacial CT with contrast shows opacification of the right middle ear cavity, which is likely due to an infection. The opacification of the right mastoid air cells is also present, but normal opacification of the adjacent sigmoid sinuses and jugular veins suggests that there is no significant venous obstruction. The presence of a small mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus is a benign finding.

The clinical concern for infection is supported by the drainage from the right ear and the opacification of the right middle ear cavity. The patient's symptoms of hypotension and increased somnolence may be related to the infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the extent of the infection and to provide appropriate treatment.

I would recommend further evaluation, including:

* A thorough ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination to assess the extent of the infection
* A culture of the right middle ear cavity to identify the causative organism
* Antibiotic therapy to treat the infection
* Follow-up imaging to assess the response to treatment and to monitor for any complications

It is also essential to note that the patient's chronic microvascular ischemia may be contributing to their symptoms, and further evaluation and management may be necessary to address this underlying condition.<|eot_id|>",0.4705882352941176,,llama_base,"Hypotension and increased somnolence with drainage from right ear. Concern for infection.   Procedure: Helical CT of the head performed without administration of contrast. Following intravenous contrast administration, axial images through the facial bones. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions. Comparisons: Head MRI of 7/17/2017.  Findings: There is streak artifact limiting assessment of the ventral portions of the brain on the basis of patient positioning.  CT of the head:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of a large area tentorial infarction by CT at this time within the constraints of the exam. There is moderate generalized brain parenchymal volume loss for patient's age  with commensurate ventriculomegaly. There are patchy periventricular and subcortical white matter signal hypodensities most reflective of chronic microvascular ischemia.  Maxillofacial CT:  There is opacification of the left greater than right mastoid air cells. Normal opacification of the adjacent sigmoid sinuses and jugular veins. There is mild mucosal thickening of the bony external auditory canal. There is complete opacification of the  right middle ear cavity. There are no discrete erosive changes of the osseous structures of the right middle ear. There is diffuse mucosal thickening of the ethmoid complexes. There is mild mucosal thickening involving the inferior right maxillary  antrum. A small mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus."
