The intracranial CTA images show symmetric appearance to the middle cerebral arteries and anterior cerebral arteries and posterior cerebral arteries. There is a segment of a sylvian branch of the right middle cerebral artery seen best on series 9 image  221 which shows diminished contrast likely from intravascular thrombus. This area is seen in the proximal sylvian portion of the right middle cerebral artery also identified on series 15 image 41. Coronal series 16 image 27 shows this segment measuring  approximately 7 mm with diminished flow and caliber change.  The same area may be seen on series 17 image 50  On the perfusion weighted scans the cerebral blood flow maps shows a segmental area of reduction in perfusion within the right middle cerebral artery distribution affecting the right posterior frontal opercular region extending to the top of the sylvian  fissure. The time to drain sequences show a greater area of right middle cerebral artery diminished perfusion. The cerebral blood volume maps does not show a deficit."
